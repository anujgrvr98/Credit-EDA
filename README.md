# Credit-EDA

This case study focuses on spotting patterns indicating if clients might struggle with loan repayments. It aims to help make decisions like rejecting loans, reducing loan amounts, or offering loans with higher interest rates to risky applicants, while ensuring deserving clients aren't denied. By using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), the goal is to pinpoint applicants at risk of defaulting.

Put simply, the company wants to uncover the key factors driving loan defaultsâ€”known as driver variables. This understanding can then inform portfolio management and risk assessment strategies.

To better grasp the domain, it's recommended to research risk analytics, particularly the types of variables and their importance in predicting loan default.
